  # Project Overview
This analysis provides insights into pricing trends and revenue for short-term rental listings. The dataset focuses on the following key metrics:

Average Price per Bedroom
Average Price by Zip Code
Revenue by Year
 # 1. Average Price per Bedroom
This analysis calculates the average price per bedroom based on the dataset:

1 Bedroom: $96.2
2 Bedrooms: $175.4
3 Bedrooms: $249.7
4 Bedrooms: $315.4
5 Bedrooms: $450
6 Bedrooms: $584.8
From the data, we can observe that as the number of bedrooms increases, the average price also rises, indicating that larger properties tend to have higher rental prices.

 # 2. Average Price by Zip Code
The average price for rental listings in different zip codes reveals the following:

Most Expensive: Zip code 98134 with an average price of $206.6.
Middle Price: Zip code 98144 with an average price of $109.9.
Cheapest: Zip code 98125 with an average price of $64.7.
This data indicates that the prices vary significantly depending on the location, with zip code 98134 being the most expensive and 98125 being the least expensive.

 # 3. Revenue by Year (2016)
Revenue generated over the year 2016 is analyzed by dividing the year into four quarters:

First Quarter (Jan-Mar): $1,896,838
Second Quarter (Apr-Jun): $1,991,762
Third Quarter (Jul-Sep): $2,009,293
Fourth Quarter (Oct-Dec): $1,818,398
The revenue shows steady growth from the first to the third quarter, followed by a slight decrease in the fourth quarter. This could be influenced by seasonal trends or external factors impacting demand in the last months of the year.

 # Conclusion
The data provides valuable insights into pricing trends based on bedroom count and zip code location, along with revenue generation patterns throughout 2016. The findings suggest that both the size of the property and its geographical location significantly affect rental prices, and revenue tends to be higher in mid-year periods.
